                                            was looking to shift their process online. The organization connects People In Need, individuals requiring some form of volunteer help, with Volunteers, skilled or unskilled people looking to offer help.

                                            The design project was cumulative, and took a good chunk of a semester to produce. The first half involved the design of particular challenging pages and features, like posts and chats.
                                            Design decisions also included choosing a color scheme that follows best practice guidelines, and designing potential animations and mobile designs.

                                            <br>
                                            After teams came together to produce a finalized design, my contribution to the design included a grid of post cards representing the tasks that People in Need require help with.
                                            The design we went with for the Login and Registraton pages were also based on my designs, and the color palette, though not necessarily it's application, was the one I had created.

                                            The user would be presented with a grid of posts, with the posts being a card design. Any user could create a post requesting help and have it added to the grid. The goal was to allow users to interact with the site in whatever way they needed to.

                                            One of the design principles we focused on was privacy. We didn't request much information to create an account because users, especially people in need, may be hesitant to give information like their phone number out online.
                                            We considered allowing users to see posts without creating an account, but we didn't move forward with that because of privacy concerns.

                                            To provide additional value to the organization, we also produced an atomized Figma UI Kit, which allows additional designs to be created quickly, and offers guidance on how to utilize elements.
                                            To culminate the project, we presented the design, along with the prototype and UI Kit to the theoretical stakeholders. The process of creating the presentation was a bit of a project in itself, and we took careful consideration to try and make an effective presentation.

                                            The stakeholders were mostly pleased with the design, offering criticism and feedback heavily directed towards the messaging of our design meeting, but would pursue the design after further development of a few features.
