                    <h3>An ongoing project to develop a Discord bot using Node, Javascript, and the Discord API.</h3>

                            <h3>1. Problem</h3>
                            <div class="section-content">
                                <div class="left">                                    
                                        <p>A few years ago, under the guidance of Google, Discord banned a bot named <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640024/youtube-discord-groovy-music-bot-closure" class="secondary underline">Groovy</a> which allowed users to play Youtube videos during chats with their friends.
                                        The Discord server I share with some of my friends was really dissapointed by this. We swapped to a few other bots to fill the same niche, but soon enough they all got banned too. Eventually, I got sick of it, and decided to look into creating my own bot.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        The situation with Groovy and other such music bots involved their monetization practice. Essentially, they were allowing users to use Youtube content without watching ads, and then allowing users to pay for "Premium Services" from the bot.
                                        Google looked to get them banned because they were profitting off of Google's property. By keeping my bot for personal use, and refraining from monetizing it, it's unlikely Google will take any offense.

                                        <p>The bot is currently in early devlopment. Currently, I have a rules feature that generates a list of rules as a text embed when either a user joins a server or the bot is commanded to.
                                            The voting feature is also in the later stages of development. It allows users with an Administrator or Moderator role to create a vote embed. The bot automatically keeps tally of users
                                            responses to determine whether the vote passes or not, and updates the embed element accordingly.

                                            Next steps include having the bot automatically enforce rules limiting the profanity in text chat and the Youtube video player. Once I have those added, I'm going to switch to looking into deploying my bot, 
                                            maintaining it, and adding user requested features.
