                                    <p class="text">I was part of an initiative to upgrade our plants computers to Windows 11. We had recently delivered a new laptop to a Warehouse Technician,
                                        when he reported back that he could no longer use the site we had to collect signatures using his 
                                        <a href="https://topazsystems.com/standard/t-s460.html">Topaz Signature Capture Pad</a>. The signature capture process is vital for the whole Logistics department, as it's necessary
                                        to get signatures for Bills of Lading, legal documents that track the movement and shipment of goods. Until the situation was remedied, the Warehouse Tech could not capture signatures,
                                        and upgrades for computers in the Logistics department were put on hold. A temporary solution had to be found for the warehouse, and a permanent on would have to be found to continue 
                                        the upgrading process.</p>

                                    <p>The first part of the project involved getting the signature capture pad working for the Warehouse Tech. I looked at the html file for the site the IT department originally created to 
                                        communicate with the pads, and found it required ActiveX to function. Windows 11 eliminated support for Internet Explorer and ActiveX with it, but luckily I was able to find a compatability
                                        mode in Microsoft Edge to allow the site to use ActiveX. That was enough to work for now, but the project had landed on me to find a permanent replacement.

                                    <p>The site I developed solved the business probem entirely: the pads were working, the BOL signature capture process was tested and functional, and the Windows 11 upgrade process in the
                                        Logistics department resumed. The continuation of developing an in-house software means there were no fees with introducing or maintaining the solution, and the readability and documentation
                                        of my code allowed others in the department to deliver and troubleshoot the site without prior experience with HTML, JavaScript, or the Topaz SDK. I was also very pleased to hear that the 
                                        users of the site in the Logistics department were very happy with the new site as well. They were especially pleased that the site did not require them to change their workflow or learn a new process.
