                                <div class="left">
                                    <p>I was part of an initiative to upgrade our plants computers to Windows 11. We had recently delivered a new laptop to a Warehouse Technician,
                                        when he reported back that he could no longer use the site we had to collect signatures using his

                                        to get signatures for Bills of Lading, legal documents that track the movement and shipment of goods. Until the situation was remedied, the Warehouse Tech could not capture signatures,
                                        and upgrades for computers in the Logistics department had to be put on hold. A temporary solution had to be found for the warehouse, and a permanent one would have to be found to continue 
                                        the upgrading process.</p>

                                    <p>The first part of the project involved getting the signature capture pad working for the Warehouse Tech. I looked at the html file for the site the IT department originally created to 
                                        communicate with the pads, and found it required ActiveX to function. Windows 11 eliminated support for Internet Explorer and ActiveX with it, but luckily I was able to find a compatability
                                        mode in Microsoft Edge to allow the site to use ActiveX. That was enough to work for now, but the project to find a permanent solution had landed on me.

                                <h3>3. My Solution to the Problem</h3>
                                <div class="left">
                                    <p>The site was kept on a computer in the Logistics areas, but the process involved the semi-truck drivers themselves entering the numbers associated with the BOL in an input, signing the pad, and clicking a save button. The site would 
                                        then download an image of the signature for each of the BOL numbers inputed on the page to a predetermined location on the network. I didn't think the modern norm of web-browsers favors allowing a website 
                                        to have direct access to the users filesystem, so my first theory was that the old site would need more than a patchjob to work. 
                                        I started with speaking with Topaz support to see what they recommended and examining solutions others had came up with online.
                                        Nothing seemed to fit our circumstance, so I examined full BOL Signature Gathering hardware and technology. 
                                        The existing solutions were expensive, would require restructuring the way the process already worked, and would make the signature pads we had worthless, so they were undesirable. 
                                        I decided to look at ways to make a new site.
                                    </br>
                                    </br>
                                        At first, I was going to make the site using PHP, because a server-side site would be able to speak to the network filesystem. However, we weren't already using PHP on the server for anything, and the setup process
                                        was unfeasible, so I decided to exhaust everything I could on the client-side first. I found the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/topaz-sigplusextlite-back/dhcpobccjkdnmibckgpejmbpmpembgco?hl=en" target="_blank" class="accent">Topaz SigPlusExtLite</a> Chrome extension.
                                        Using the extension I could get a local site to communicate with the pad and return a Base64 string of the user signature. I figured out how to convert the Base64 into an image 
                                        using the JavaScript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob" target="_blank" class="accent">Blob</a> object that the user could then download to their computer. This mimicked the previous workflow,
                                        but it could only save the files to the devices downloads folder, which wasn't very useful. I was so close, but it seemed like I wouldn't be able to make it work.
                                    </br>
                                    </br>
                                        I explored and combed through everything I could, until I stumbled on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileSystem" target="_blank" class="accent">JavaScript Filesystem API</a>.
                                        I got a version working that opened up the Windows File Explorer when the save button was clicked, which still wasn't a satisfying solution. I was then able to figure out how to get the browser to allow the user
                                        to select a file directory once, keep that path in memory until the window is closed, and save the images at that directory whenever the user gives the input to. I just set the page up to hide fields until the user selects the directory, and sent it out to test.
                                        I also made a point to make it look just like the old site, even though it's not the prettiest, and it included on-page instructions that I could modify for the new one. The Logistics department opens the page anyways when they turn the computer on, so they were happy
                                        with only having to add a single additional step to make the site work. The drivers didn't even notice the difference.

                                    <p>The site I developed solved the business probem entirely: the pads were working, the BOL signature capture process was tested and functional, and the Windows 11 upgrade process in the
                                        Logistics department resumed. The continuation of developing an in-house software means there were no fees with introducing or maintaining the solution, and the readability and documentation
                                        of my code allowed others in the department to deliver and troubleshoot the site without prior experience with HTML, JavaScript, or the Topaz SDK. I was also very pleased to hear that the 
                                        users of the site in the Logistics department were very happy with the new site as well. They were especially pleased that the site did not require them to change their workflow or learn a new process.
